#building blocks 
##create a* algo to understand how it works 
### use with maze
### use with node tree

##understand q learning 


##combine qlearning with a*
### in mazes
### in node tree 



#proof of concept 

##create a dataset that ranks different outputs of llms (use laion open assistant model to generate synthetic data) 

##create a model that ranks each sentence (different parameter constraints could make different personalities)

##then combine token generation , rank x token choices with the model ranking model , use a* to choose best path that ranks the best
